Architected a multi-agent LangGraph system with 4+ specialized tools (weather info, place search, expense calculator, currency converter) orchestrated through state machine workflows; integrated multiple LLM providers (Google Gemini, OpenAI GPT, Groq) with fallback mechanisms for 99%+ uptime.

Implemented real-time data retrieval pipeline connecting 5+ external APIs (OpenWeatherMap, Google Places, Exchange Rate API) to deliver live weather forecasts, location details, and pricing information, enabling dynamic itinerary adjustments based on current conditions.

Developed dual-architecture deployment with FastAPI backend (REST API) and Streamlit frontend, supporting concurrent user sessions with CORS-enabled architecture, deployed on Render cloud platform with automatic scaling capabilities.

Engineered comprehensive travel planning capabilities including day-by-day itineraries, hotel recommendations with pricing, restaurant suggestions, activity planning, transportation options, and detailed expense breakdowns with multi-currency support, providing users with 360° trip planning in a single interface.
